# Introduction
The project aims to automate crack detection in concrete structures using a binary classification model. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of concrete surfaces into two categories: POSITIVE and NEGATIVE.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of:

Positive Images: Images with visible cracks.
Negative Images: Images without cracks.
The images are stored in two directories:

Positive/ for cracked concrete images.
Negative/ for non-cracked concrete images.

# Requirements
The project requires the following libraries and frameworks:

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.0+
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly
scikit-learn

# Install the dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ChandraPrakashC/crack-detection.git
cd crack-detection

Place your dataset in the Positive/ and Negative/ directories as required.

# Run the script:
python crack_detection.py
View training metrics, validation results, and final accuracy.

# Model Architecture
The implemented CNN has the following architecture:

Input Layer: (120, 120, 3) - RGB images resized to 120x120.
Convolutional Layers: Two layers with ReLU activation.
Pooling Layers: Max pooling to reduce spatial dimensions.
Global Average Pooling: Reduces data dimensionality before passing it to the dense layer.
Output Layer: A single neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

# Results
Validation Accuracy: 97.98%
Test Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy on the test dataset with minimal overfitting.
Confusion matrix and other performance metrics are visualized in the results.

# Future Improvements
Data Augmentation: Enhance the modelâ€™s robustness by applying random transformations to the dataset.
Model Optimization: Experiment with more advanced architectures like ResNet or MobileNet.
Deployment: Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-world applications.
